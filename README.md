# Portfolio V2

mmmm much portfolio... how nice

But Serieously, V2 of my portfolio site is built with astro because I wanted to incorporate a blog(and other features you can check out in `dev-notebook.md`) alongside it, and do a major redesign since the last one was neither responsive, nor accessible. 
So I will gut pretty much the whole site barring the HTML, and start from there. 

Built, with Love, on Astro

### todo:

- fix the styling for all pages, page by page.
