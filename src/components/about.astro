      <p>Hiya! 👋🏽</p>
      <p>I'm a Computer Science major at the University of Houston. I love Software-Engineering, Cryptography, and Cybersecurity, and I love discussing tech, cars, planes, rockets, cool science topics, and everything in between!</p>
      <p>I lead CodeRed at CougarCS, organizing Houston's largest hackathon, and am part of the CougarCS Infosec CTF Team, focusing on cybersecurity challenges and workshops. I am also the Software Team Lead for Undergraduate Student Instrumentation Project VI (USIP VI), where we build and test balloon-borne experiments.</p>
