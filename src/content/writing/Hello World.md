Welcome to my corner of the internet! This site is *my space*—a place where I can share, create, and showcase all the things I’m love. Whether it’s tech, projects, or just some random musings, this is where it all comes together. Let me tell you a bit about why this site exists and what you can expect to find here.

## Why This Site Exists

First and foremost, this site is a reflection of me. It’s styled exactly how I like it—minimal, functional, and with a sprinkle of personality. Think of it as my digital playground where I can experiment, write, and share whatever’s on my mind.

I created this site because I wanted a space that’s entirely mine. Social media is great and all, but there’s something special about having your own little slice of the web. Here, I can post about anything—whether it’s cool projects I’ve worked on, lessons learned from my experiences in software engineering or cybersecurity, or even just random thoughts that pop into my head.

So far, this site has three main "corners":
- **[Projects](https://hitarth.dev/projects)**: A showcase of the things I’ve built or contributed to.
- **[Career](https://hitarth.dev/career)**: My journey in tech, in short bullet points.
- **[Writing](https://hitarth.dev/writing)**: Aka my blogging corner. There are already a few ideas brewing for future posts—some are just waiting for the right spark of inspiration to bring them to life.

But honestly? I have no idea what this site might evolve into. The beauty of having my own space is that it can grow and change as I age. 

Maybe someday I’ll completely revamp it (if you’re curious about that process, check out my post on [moving to Astro from React](https://hitarth.dev/moving-to-astro-from-react).

For now, though, this is where I’ll be sharing everything that excites me. From tech to science to random thoughts about rockets or cars, this blog is just the beginning. Thanks for stopping by—I hope you come back soon!
