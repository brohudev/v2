**TLDR:**
- Technical skills don't matter as much as teamwork, communication and luck.
- Every hackathon is different; adaptability is your greatest asset.
- Networking is more valuable than any single project you'll build.
- Don't chase wins, chase learning and upskilling.
- Time is the only rare commodity, so plan early, plan beforehand, and don't pivot.
- Never leave Fist Principles thinking on the table.

## Pre-yap:
Hackathons are always a wild tossup. You never know if you'll end up winning. 

My Projects have always been duct taped together, Team communication either becomes cold, or outright falls apart (True story). You're completely wired on caffeine and in no way, shape, or form fit enough to drive back home afterwards (Happened to a friend of mine).

And yet, I still attend these competitions and try to make an idea come to fruition within an impossibly tight deadline. 

This post is an attempt to reconcile the loose list of learnings over the past year of attending about 6 odd hackathons:
- TAMUhack X (January 2024)
- HackSMUVi (October 2024)
- HackTUD (November 2024)
- NSBE x UH Hackathon (November 2024)
- Hacklytics (February 2025)
- QVIDTVM x Ion Inaugural Hackday (Feb 2025)

This list is not meant to be an exhaustive and/or a restrictive set of principles for people looking to jump into hacking culture, but as a list of guide rails that are to be heeded and disregarded at the reader's discretion.

So without further ado, and in no particular order, this is what I've taken away from the 6 hackathons I've Been to:

### 1. Time is the only metric that matters
- nothing else. 
- this means everything down to the hour should have a fairly well thought out plan in advance. 
- the more time you spend WHILE THE HACKAHTON COUNTER IS RUNNING working on non project stuff (apart from necessity like sleep, food, bathroom breaks) you are loosing to more potential features or a more featured project. 
- to this end you should have multiple projects, team member specializations, and ideas for the track you want to work on alr at the ready DURING the opening ceremony so you hit the ground running. 
- repeat after me, time is the only metric that matters.

### 2. Your Team can be your Vibranium, or your Kryptonite
- aka dont pick random teammates
- go with people you know are going to lock in just like you. 
- cold teammates are bad, and a dysfunctional teammate is worse, cut them out and don't be shy of calling out bs

### 3. Your Judges are the real "Judge, Jury, and Executioner"
- during pitches you are a salesman, and your product is your project idea (yep not the mvp), 
- the mvp should only act as a proof of concept and show that your idea has potential.

### 4. Don't Focus on the prize if you want to win
- because that will impact how you design your pitch/presentation. 
- judges can see a prize hungry project from miles away. yours need to have an x factor, and that is easily achievable if you straight up let go of the prize as the constraint and focus on building cool shit.

### 7. Soft Skills Matter More Than the Tech Stack
- dont be a homebody, go have yap sessions with the recruiters at the tables before hacking, 
- strike up conversations with fellow hackers
- attend the bob ross painting workshops, those are super fun.

### 9. Caffeine will kill your productivity
- Hackathons are marathons, not sprints
- Sleep, nutrition, and mental breaks are not optional
- Burnout is real and counterproductive
- no more than 100mg of caffeine per day and no less than 8 hrs of sleep for every full day at your hackathon. 
- remember, seasoned senior swes cant focus on outputting good code for more than five hours per day, and you will rarely be judged on your code quality, so you need to maximize focus in order to build and iterate fast.

## Final Thoughts
Winning at Hackathons is a positive externality. The focus of going to a Hackathon should ideally be about pushing your limits in some capacity, learning rapidly, and connecting with people who share your passion for technology.

Ironically I've only won awards when I have let go of hard and fast rules and instead focused on a simple problem and iterate on the idea.

## whats next for me;
- HackKU (April 2025)
- fall 2025: hacktx, hakutd, hacksmu, hackrice, and many more throughout texas!
