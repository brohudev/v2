tldr: React is a great library... however it is not great when you want a fast simple and useful site where you can quickly get to the things you want and focus more on the user side of things instead of making everything jsx. 

- what i had before this:
	- single page react app
		- had a paragraph
		- had a direly terrible pfp
		- had all my links
	- aka it got the job done. it was barely a portfolio
- what i wanted:
	- a site where i can configure the design and the content on the site seperately
	- a site where i can start my own blog with the following requirements:
		- content will be in markdown
		- there should be an rss feed
		- there should be my own rss by email plugin
		- aka no lockin to proprietary platforms like substack like substack, great as they are. 
	- a site where i can display a growing list of my projects and expereinces
		- aka more than just a single homepage on the internet. 
		- i wanted it to be a collection of links where i can tinker with things i like on my own terms. 
		- "my corner of the internet, my way"
- what i did:
	- built a site in astro + tailwind. used the rose pine theme and drew heavy inspiration from mitchell hashimoto's own site (it was around the time of the ghostty release, which ive switched over to from kitty as soon as it came out...)
- what i used:
	- astro: ssg ++. maybe someday ill write my own hugo/jekyll template but for now this serves my needs well
	- tailwind: styling but made bearable for the human
	- thats p much it
	- apart from the nav bar that had to use react because of my vision
- so yeah. enjoy my site! ill post more thoughts, project overviews, and tech rants in the coming weeks/months/year over here and who knows, the site will most likely evolve into something better tooo!
